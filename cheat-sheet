Cheat-Sheet for commands that I might need in future.
(I have memory of a gold fish)

xprop | grep WM_CLASS
Returns class name of opened window. Very useful to set some properties for specific apps (i.e. i3 configuration and float mode)

xev
Returns name of pressed keys. Very useful to make custom keyboard shortcuts.

# Bash scripts
These are bash scripts I wrote for personal use. Feel free to use/modify them.

## todo
Simple to do list script for tracking tasks. To learn how to use it please look into source file (it's short :D).\
Flags:\
`-p` print content of default list\
`-c` clear content of default list\
`-t` add new tasks\
`-e` add new event\
`-i` add new important task

## hello
Just Hello World...

## auto-link
This script automates the process of creating symbolic links on linux. It's very useful if you have your config files in other directory than `.config` (as I do). Just go to the source directory and run this script with destination directory. It also should prevent the `Too many levels of symbolic links` error.

## update
Just `sudo pacman -Syu` with some silly output.

## time/*
I was bored and had some free time from studying for my finals, so I made the decision to become a computer nomad, and to do that I started delving into the beauty and simplicity of plain C. Here is the fruit of my fun and fatigue, a few binary files to display the current date and time. This is part of another project, but it was so cute I had to add it here.
